# PHCM9785_modelling_workshop

Code to support R workshop on modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission using the package nimue.

Today we will be going through a brief introduction to the basics of programming in R, using R Studio, followed by some exercises demonstrating how modelling has been used to support decisions around the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, using a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The transmission model was developed at Imperial College London and is downloadable and open-source as a package in R.

Documentation for the package is available here:
